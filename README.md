You need to add the plugin into your medusa-config.js as shown below

```
const plugins = [
  ...,
  {
    resolve:`medusa-payment-phonepe`,
  

   options: {
                redirectUrl: "http://localhost:8000/api/payment-confirmed",
                callbackUrl: "http://localhost:9000/phonepe/hook",
                salt: process.env.PHONEPE_SALT,
                merchantId:
                    process.env.PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT,
                mode: process.env.PHONEPE_MODE,
                redirectMode: "POST"
            }
  
  },
  ...]
```
you can replace http://localhost:8000 with your http(s)://your-client-domain
you can replace http://localhost:9000 with your http(s)://your-server-hook
## Client side configuration


For the nextjs start you need to  make the following changes 

1. Install package to your next starter. This just makes it easier, importing all the scripts implicitly
```

```
2. Create a route to handle post requests from phone pe by creating a route under
  /app/api/payment-confirmed/route.ts

in that add the following code 

```
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */
/* eslint-disable require-jsdoc */
import { medusaClient } from "@lib/config";
import { createPostCheckSumHeader } from "@lib/util/phonepe-create-post-checksum-header";

import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { PaymentStatusCodeValues } from "types/phonepe-types";

export async function POST(
    request: NextRequest,
    _response: NextResponse
): Promise<NextResponse<unknown>> {
    const urlSplit = request.url.split("//");
    const base = urlSplit[1].split("/")[0];

    const data = await request.formData();

    const receivedChecksum = data.get("checksum");
    const merchantTransactionId = data.get("transactionId");
    const code = data.get("code");
    const merchantId = data.get("merchantId");

    let verificationData = "";
    const providerReferenceId = data.get("providerReferenceId");

    let cartId = merchantTransactionId?.valueOf() as string;
    const cartIdParts = cartId.split("_");
    cartId = `${cartIdParts[0]}_${cartIdParts[1]}`;

    let redirectPath: string | undefined;
    const redirectErrorPath = `/cart`;

    if (code?.valueOf() == PaymentStatusCodeValues.PAYMENT_SUCCESS) {
        if (!merchantTransactionId?.valueOf() || !merchantId?.valueOf()) {
            notFound();
        }
    } else if (code?.valueOf() != PaymentStatusCodeValues.PAYMENT_SUCCESS) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(`/cart`);
    } else {
        data.forEach((value, key) => {
            if (key != "checksum") verificationData += value;
        });

        const { checksum } = createPostCheckSumHeader(
            verificationData,
            process.env.PHONEPE_SALT,
            ""
        );

        if (
            checksum == receivedChecksum?.valueOf() ||
            !process.env.TEST_DISABLED
        ) {
            if (checksum != receivedChecksum?.valueOf()) {
                console.warn("running in test mode.. This is dangerous!! ");
            }
            
            let cartResp = await medusaClient.carts.retrieve(cartId);

            cartResp = await medusaClient.carts.updatePaymentSession(
                cartResp.cart.id,
                cartResp.cart.payment_session!.provider_id,
                {
                    data: {
                        ...cartResp.cart.payment_session?.data,
                        merchantTransacionId: merchantTransactionId,
                        providerReferenceId: providerReferenceId
                    }
                }
            );
            // console.log("updated providerReferenceId id in payment session", JSON.stringify(cartResp.cart))
            try {
                const authorizedCart = await medusaClient.carts.complete(
                    cartResp.cart.id
                );
                console.log("finalized cart");
                if (authorizedCart.data.id == cartResp.cart.id) {
                    console.log("error: " + redirectErrorPath);
                }
                redirectPath = `/order/confirmed/${authorizedCart.data.id}`;
                console.log("confirmed: ", redirectPath);
            } catch (e) {
                console.log(
                    "error: " + (e as Error).message + "\n" + JSON.stringify(e)
                );
            }
        }
    }
    const locale = request.nextUrl.locale ?? "en";
    const computedUrl = `${urlSplit[0]}//${base}${locale ? "/" + locale : ""}${
        redirectPath ?? redirectErrorPath
    }`;
    console.log("computed URL:" + computedUrl);
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(computedUrl), 302);
}

export default POST;


```

3. Create a button for PhonePe <next-starter>/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-button/phonepe-payment-button.tsx

like below



````
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */
import { PaymentSession } from "@medusajs/medusa";
import Button from "@modules/common/components/button";
import Spinner from "@modules/common/icons/spinner";
import { useCart } from "medusa-react";
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";

export const PhonePePaymentButton = ({
    session,
    notReady
}: {
    session: PaymentSession;
    notReady: boolean;
}) => {
    const [disabled, setDisabled] = useState(false);
    const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
    const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState<string | undefined>(
        undefined
    );

    const { cart } = useCart();

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(session));
        if (!session && cart?.payment.provider_id == "phonepe") {
            setDisabled(true);
        } else {
            setDisabled(false);
        }
    }, [session, cart]);

    const handlePayment = useCallback(() => {
        console.log(session);
        setSubmitting(true);
        if (!cart) {
            setSubmitting(false);
            return;
        }
        console.log(
            ((session.data.data as any).instrumentResponse as any).redirectInfo
                .url
        );
        if (
            (
                (session.data.data as any).instrumentResponse as any
            ).redirectInfo.url.includes("https")
        ) {
            window.location.replace(
                ((session.data.data as any).instrumentResponse as any)
                    .redirectInfo.url
            );
        } else {
            setErrorMessage("oops didn't get redirection path");
        }
    }, [session, cart]);

    return (
        <>
            <Button
                disabled={submitting || disabled || notReady}
                onClick={handlePayment}
            >
                {submitting ? <Spinner /> : "Checkout"}
            </Button>
            {errorMessage && (
                <div className="text-red-500 text-small-regular mt-2">
                    {errorMessage}
                </div>
            )}
        </>
    );
};
    
````

Step 3. 

nextjs-starter-medusa/src/modules/checkout/components/payment-container/index.tsx
add

```

phonepe: {
    title: "PhonePe",
    description: "PhonePe payment gateway",
  },
````

&&

```
case "phonepe":
        return (
          <PhonePePaymentButton notReady={notReady} session={paymentSession} />
        )
        


```


and add into the payment element
```
case "phonepe":
        return <></>
```
